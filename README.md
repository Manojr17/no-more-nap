**Project Overview:**

*DriverDrown is an AI-based real-time Driver Drowsiness Detection System designed to enhance road safety by continuously monitoring the driver's facial features and 
alerting them when signs of fatigue or drowsiness are detected.

*The system leverages computer vision, deep learning, and OpenCV-based facial landmark detection to analyze eye blinks, yawns, and head posture to determine the driver's 
alertness level.

*The DriverDrown system effectively demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to reduce road accidents by combating driver fatigue. 

*It is a cost-effective, real-time, and scalable solution that can be implemented in modern vehicles to promote safer driving experiences.

NOTE:

      Dataset Needed - The Shape Predictor 68 Landmark Dataset (commonly referred to as shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat) is a pre-trained facial landmark model
     widely used for detecting 68 facial landmarks like eyes, nose, mouth, jawline, etc.

Download shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2 (Compressed)

You can use Kaggle, Github or ChatGPT to download dataset.
